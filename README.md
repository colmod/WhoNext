# Who Next Application

A MEAN web app with AngularJS on the front, Express + Node + Mongoose on the back. This project is an
application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app for those who want
to use Node to serve their app.

This  is a hobby application I use to determine which of my children is next to receive a treat, who
feeds the dog, does a chore or to decide what program to watch. Eventually I want to build an iOS client
to the app, so watch this space for up dates.

Based on a number of Node, Angular and other seeds already on GitHub, it contains package and bower
dependancy files - so node_modules is excluded - download latest. Just clone the repo, download deps
and you're ready to develop your application.

The seed app shows how to wire together Angular client-side components with Express on the server.
It also illustrates writing angular partials/views with the Jade templating library.

## How to use Who Next Application

Clone the angular-express-seed repository, run `npm install` to grab the dependencies, and start hacking!

### Running the app

Runs like a typical express app:

    node server.js
